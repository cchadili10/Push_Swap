# Push_Swap Project

## Overview
The push_swap project is a challenging algorithmic exercise aimed at sorting data on a stack with a limited set of instructions and the smallest number of moves possible.

## Objective
The main goal is to sort numbers into stack A using the least possible number of operations. This is achieved by manipulating two stacks (A and B) with a set of instructions.

## Final Grade
125/125

## Mandatory Part
- Program name: push_swap
- Turn in files: Makefile, *.h, *.c
- Makefile: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
- Arguments: stack A - A list of integers
- External functions: read, write, malloc, free, exit, ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
- Libft authorized: Yes
  
For maximal project validation, for 100 random numbers, there should be no more than 700 operations & 500 random numbers, there should be no more than 5500 operations. Develop your own checker program that will verify the sequence of operations applied to sort the stack.

## Description
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.
